// The bridge-prefs record, held once per endpoint instead of once per caller.
//
// `useBridgePrefs` used to be a plain hook over `useState`, so every component
// that called it loaded its own copy with its own `GET /bridge-prefs` and kept
// it privately. Two consumers on one page therefore disagreed the moment either
// wrote, and this record is not a display cache: it holds `max_budget` and
// `disabled_tools`. `PUT /bridge-prefs` replaces a harness's record whole, so
// every writer merges over the copy it is holding — and a stale copy does not
// merely show an old ceiling, it writes the old ceiling back over a cleared one.
//
// Same shape as `SharedPoll`, for the same reason, minus the timer: prefs are
// read once and then only change because somebody on this page changed them.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT do is check whether the server accepted the
// write. `updatePrefs` has always set local state first and awaited the PUT
// without reading its status, so a refused write leaves every subscriber
// showing a value the server does not have. Sharing the record makes that
// visible on more surfaces at once rather than causing it; changing it is a
// behaviour change and is filed separately.
