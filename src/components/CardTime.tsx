/**
 * A card's clock, as a badge.
 *
 * It answers the question a board is actually asked — is this late? — which
 * needs two numbers, not one. A card that arrived yesterday and spent all of it
 * waiting on somebody else's reply has burned none of its limit; a card opened
 * an hour ago and worked the whole hour has burned half a two-hour one. Reporting
 * age alone cannot tell those apart, so the badge leads with the budget clock and
 * keeps elapsed in the tooltip.
 *
 * A card with no limit still gets the badge, showing what it has spent with
 * nothing to spend it against.
 *
 * A card with a limit but no recorded actions is the live majority: every card
 * that existed before the event log did. Its limit is real and worth showing,
 * and its spend is not zero but unknown — so the badge states the rung and the
 * limit and puts a dash where the figure would go. Printing 0s there would be a
 * measurement the data never supported, and on a card that has sat for months it
 * would be the most reassuring number on the board.
