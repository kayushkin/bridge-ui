/**
 * The token that lets a browser join a pty session's terminal.
 *
 * ## Why this is fetched and not remembered
 *
 * `POST /sessions/{id}/mode` answers a switch to pty with an `attach_token`, and
 * bridge-ui caches that answer in a per-session map (`useBridgeSession`'s
 * `attachTokens`). That map is memory: reload the tab and the token is gone, and the
 * only way bridge-ui gets another is to switch the session's mode AGAIN — which kills
 * and respawns the harness process to re-mint a token the server was already holding.
 *
 * `GET /sessions/{id}/attach-token` exists precisely so a client does not have to do
 * that; the gateway's own comment says so (`attach.go:52-56`). So this reads the
 * server's token whenever the session is in pty mode, which makes the terminal
 * survive a refresh and makes the mode switch a thing you do once.
 *
 * ## A 404 is an answer, not a failure
 *
 * The endpoint 404s when the session has no live pty hub — a session that WAS pty and
 * whose process has since gone. That is not an error to report in red; it is the
 * server saying "there is no terminal here, switch the mode to spin one up". It comes
 * back as `absent`, which the pane renders as that sentence.
 *
 * Any other failure IS reported. A gateway that is down and a session with no
 * terminal are different situations and must not read alike.
