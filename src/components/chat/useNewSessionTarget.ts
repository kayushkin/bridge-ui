/** The instance and harness a new chat targets on this page — the "+ New" button and

 *
 *  The ladder is bridge-ui's (`BridgeChat.tsx`), and it resolves from RECORDED prefs
 *  only, never a first-enabled guess:
 *    1. the exact recorded last instance (`last_instance_id`), if it is still enabled;
 *    2. else an enabled instance of the recorded last harness (`last_harness`),
 *       preferring one that has actually been used (it has a `last_session` entry), so
 *       the harness shown is the user's real last one rather than an invented pick;
 *    3. else undefined — nothing is recorded, so nothing is targeted.
 *
 *  Onto whichever instance that ladder finds, the harness's saved defaults are merged
 *  (`prefs.defaults[harness]` — the record the Settings page writes and the original
 *  chat applies at `Workspace.tsx`). Without them a new chat came up on the harness's
 *  own fallback model however many times the user had set a default, and its spend
 *  ceiling and disabled-tool list were dropped outright.
 *
 *  Prefs are the same server-side record the original chat at `/` reads and writes
 *  (`GET/PUT {basePath}/bridge-prefs`), so a choice made on either surface is honoured
 *  by the other. `basePath` comes from the BridgeProvider context rather than a literal
 *  so both pages resolve one endpoint. */
