/* Vibe chunking for the chat Turns view.
 *
 * An assistant's final answer arrives as one undifferentiated wall of markdown, and the
 * one sentence in it that says "this drops every un-acked message" reads exactly like
 * the four sentences around it that say what was renamed. This module cuts that answer
 * into its top-level markdown blocks and gives each block a VIBE — a member of a closed
 * six-value set — so the pane can draw a coloured rail and a gutter glyph beside the
 * unusual ones and leave an ordinary answer looking ordinary.
 *
 * Adjacent blocks that agree form a RUN, and each block is told where it sits in one
 * (`data-vibe-run`). The rail is per-run, not per-block: one continuous stripe capped by
 * one glyph, rather than a fresh bar and a repeated emoji beside every paragraph. That
 * distinction is the reason `runPositions` exists — the heading rule below promotes a
 * whole section to one vibe by writing that vibe into every block in it, so without runs
 * a six-block warning section draws six bars and six ⚠️ for what is one warning.
 *
 * Three properties this file is built around, all of them constraints from the todo
 * (`43eac69c-3ad2-448a-848a-2cc6e7aaad80`) rather than preferences:
 *
 * 1. **The rendered markdown does not change — only what wraps it.** The classification
 *    is a remark transformer that WRAPS each top-level node in a `div[data-vibe]` and
 *    touches nothing inside it. It does not re-parse, re-serialize, or split the source
 *    into separate renders, so a table stays one table, a fenced block stays one fence,
 *    and `remarkRefChips` still sees the tree `remark-gfm` shaped.
 * 2. **The taxonomy is closed.** `VIBES` is the whole set; `classifyBlock` returns a
 *    member of it or `descriptive`, never a free-form string, and the rules are a TABLE
 *    rather than an if-chain so adding one is adding a row.
 * 3. **Unclassifiable stays `descriptive` and renders as it does today.** There is no
 *    "probably a warning" tier and no fallback guessing.
 *
 * Accuracy is deliberately modest. These are structure-and-prefix heuristics: near
 * perfect on the things that announce themselves (GFM alerts, code fences, tables) and
 * wrong perhaps a fifth of the time on plain prose. The todo's option 3 (a cheap model
 * classifying behind the heuristics and overwriting them) is a separate, later, paid
 * step; this layer costs nothing, needs no network, and is what that step would overlay.
