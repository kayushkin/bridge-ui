  //    have already dismissed. The row keeps its ordinary status dot — the state is still
  //    the state, and hiding that would be a lie — it just gets no way to open the
  //    question from here.
  //  - Sessions the active FILTER CHIPS exclude never surface one either, and that falls
  //    out of where the marker lives: `groups` is chat-core's filtered set, so a row that
  //    is filtered out is not rendered and has nothing to draw a marker on. The sidebar
  //    deliberately does not reach past the filter to count them — a filter is the user
  //    narrowing what they want to see, and a badge that ignored it would be a second,
  //    louder list.
  // The union — see `waitingOnOperator` in `Sidebar`. A question outlives the state that
  // raised it, so `completed` and `aborted` rows keep their `?`; `awaiting_permission`
  // mints no signal, so the state half still has to be here. Both halves are the
