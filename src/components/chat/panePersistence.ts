// part of that switch with a per-pane visibility flag, which is what bridge-ui's
// `PanesHidden` (bridge-ui `chat/types.ts`) has always been.
//
// ⚠️ The key is chat's own, for the reason `sidebarPersistence.ts` states at length:
// dash served bridge-ui's chat beside its own while both existed — one origin and one
// localStorage. bridge-ui persists its own visibility inside the single
// `bridge-ui-workspaces` blob, keyed per workspace and validated by its own parser, so
// there is no shared row to join on even if the two pages wanted one.

/** The panes chat can draw.
 *
 *  `raw` is not here, and that is the one call this record had to make. bridge-ui has no
 *  `PaneKey` for it, so the two vocabularies are not a superset relation and the answer
 *  could not be copied. It was measured instead: `TurnList` takes `view: 'turns' | 'raw'`
 *  (`TurnList.tsx`) and renders the same transcript either way — Raw keeps the
 *  duplicates, the source and the eventId that the collapsed view drops. One component,
 *  two renderings of one thing. `Timeline` is a different component over a different
 *  derivation (`selectTimeline`).
 *
 *  So Raw is a MODE of the Turns pane, alongside the MD/TXT toggle that already modifies
 *  it, and not a pane of its own. Making it a third pane would have offered the user
 *  "show Turns beside Raw", which is the same transcript twice.
 *
 *  `kanban` IS here, and it is a pane rather than a mode for the mirror-image reason:
 *  `LinkedKanbanPanel` is a different component over a different backend
 *  (kanban-store, polled — it has no notifier), showing the cards linked to the
 *  session rather than any rendering of the transcript. "Show Turns beside the cards"
 *  is a thing a reader wants; "show Turns beside Turns" is not.
 *
 *  `git` IS here for the same reason as `kanban`, and it is the one pane bridge-ui had
 *  that dash could not reach any other way: the orchestrator has its own page at
 *  `/orchestrator` and the kanban board has `/kanban`, but `GitPanel` was mounted from
 *  the chat workspace and nowhere else, so removing that chat would have removed the
 *  repo, the branch and the working-tree diff from dash entirely. It shows what the
 *  agent has DONE to the tree while the transcript shows what it said about it, which
 *  is the pairing the pane exists for.
 *
 *  `attach` is the terminal of a session running in pty mode, and it is the ONE pane
 *  whose visibility is not this record's decision alone. A session in events mode has no
 *  pty hub to join, so the pane cannot be drawn for it whatever the stored flag says —
 *  see `visiblePanes`, which takes that as an argument rather than reading it here. The
 *  flag still means what it means: it is the user's answer for the sessions where the
 *  question can be asked at all. */
