// The arithmetic behind dragging a split boundary, kept free of React and the
// DOM so `npm run check` can pin it directly.
//
// A split lays its children out with `flex: <grow> 1 0`, so a pane's on-screen
// extent is its grow number's share of the pair's combined extent. Dragging the
// boundary moves pixels; what has to be written back is grow numbers. Every
// value named `...GrowUnits` is in that flex-grow space, every value named
// `...Pixels` is in screen space, and `pixelsPerGrowUnit` is the only bridge
// between them.
