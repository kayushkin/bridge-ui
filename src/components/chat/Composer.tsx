 *  bc-composer / bc-composer-input / bc-composer-actions / bc-composer-btn /
 *  bc-btn-stop) so it inherits the shared stylesheet.
 *
 *  Stop sits BESIDE Send rather than replacing it. The two verbs are not alternatives:
 *  a running turn is exactly when a user most often wants to redirect the model, and an
 *  exclusive ternary made Send unreachable for the whole turn. Submitting mid-turn
 *  interrupts first and then sends.
 *
 *  Which turn is "running" comes from `turnRunning` (the server-reported session state),
 *  NOT from `useComposer().sending`. `sending` is this client's own in-flight POST and
 *  clears in about a second, so a Stop button keyed on it appeared for a blink at the
 *  start of a turn and was gone for all the minutes the user might actually want it.
 *
 *  **The order is load-bearing.** `send()` is fire-and-forget optimistic (it does not
 *  return a promise), so the interrupt has to be awaited BEFORE it or the two race and
 *  the new message can reach the harness while the old turn still owns it.
 *
 *  `stop()` is a LOUD control (chat-core contract): it throws on a non-2xx (e.g. the
 *  409 the server returns while a tool still holds the turn) and sets `error` — it
 *  never optimistically fakes idle. We surface that failure inline instead of
 *  swallowing it, and a submit whose interrupt failed does NOT go on to send: the turn
 *  is demonstrably still running, so sending anyway is the race the await exists to stop.
 *
 *  Send is also refused while the session-list stream is not open (`useConnState`). The
 *  POST would still be accepted by the server, but nothing would carry the reply back,
 *  so the message would look lost.
 *
 *  Resume appears when the session's harness process is gone (`resumable` — see
 *  RESUMABLE_STATES in chat-core). It is NOT keyed on `paused`: nothing on this box
 *  emits `msg.SessionPaused`, so the "⏸ paused" label this component used to carry on
 *  its own had never once rendered, and a button behind the same flag would have been
 *  the same dead code with a click handler. `resume()` is LOUD like `stop()` — a
 *  refusal is shown, never swallowed into a fake-revived session. */

  //    the browser paints, or every keystroke that changes the line count paints once
  //    at the old height first and the box visibly jumps. ⚠️ Nothing in
  //    `e2e/chat-composer-autogrow.spec.ts` catches this one: swapping in `useEffect`

  // height we set and `overflow-y: auto` takes over past the cap. bridge-ui's own
  // Composer duplicates that number as `MAX_INPUT_PX` and then has to keep the two in
  // step by hand; reading nothing and letting the stylesheet decide leaves the cap in
  // one place.
  //
  // `scrollHeight` excludes the border, and dash sets `box-sizing: border-box` on
  // everything (`src/index.css:55`), so the height we assign has to add the border back
  // or the box lands a border-width short of its own content and scrolls by that much
  // forever. The correction lives in bridge-ui as `composerAutoGrowHeightPx` and is
