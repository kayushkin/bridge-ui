// server's transcript is that server's principal and almost certainly not
// this server's. A chip drawn inside a connected server's thread must
// therefore never ask this server's stores or resolver what an id names —
// an answer would be about a different record, given as if it were the same.
//
// The connected server's thread sets this context. Inside it a session chip
// loads through that server's store (the thread already runs against it), and
// every other kind draws a plain chip that says which server the id is from
// and that this server cannot look it up. Outside it nothing changes.
