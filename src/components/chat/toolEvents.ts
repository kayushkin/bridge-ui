// tool calls with the same five renderers the original chat uses (Bash, Grep,

//
// This is a presentation-layer conversion and it lives at the edge on purpose:
// chat-core carries the payload as it arrived (`toolInput`/`toolResult` are
// `unknown`, because the store has no business asserting a shape it did not
// define), and bridge-ui's renderers want a flat record with a string output.
// Neither side is wrong; the seam between them is here.
