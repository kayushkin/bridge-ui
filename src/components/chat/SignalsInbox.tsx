/**
 * Everything waiting on the operator, across every session — the sidebar's "Needs you" —
 * and, under it, a quieter "Background agents" group for everything else.
 *
 * ## Two groups, by session type
 *
 * "Needs you" holds the signals of interactive and herald sessions only, and only its
 * count is the operator's to clear. Autoworkers, delegates, scheduled tasks, system and
 * external sessions — and any session whose type is unknown — raise far more signals
 * than the operator does (319 of 408 open on 2026-10-19), so they are listed apart:
 * collapsed by default, neutral in colour, with their own count. Which group a signal
 * is in is chat-core's rule (`useOpenSignalsByAttention`), not this component's.
 *
 * ## Why a list, when the sidebar already marks the rows
 *
 * `QuestionMarkers` puts a `?` on the row that owns a question, and the reasoning
 * there is right as far as it goes: a count tells you a number, a marker tells you
 * WHICH ROW. What it assumes is that there IS a row.
 *
 * There usually is not. The sidebar loads a newest-first page; a session that asked
 * something and then went quiet sinks out of that page while its question stays open,
 * because a signal outlives the session state that produced it. Measured on this host
 * while building this: 21 open chat signals across 17 sessions, and 11 of those 17
 * sessions had no row in the sidebar's first page at all. Their questions were
 * unreachable in chat by any route — no row, so no marker, so nothing.
 *
 * So this is not a count replacing the markers. It is the surface for the signals
 * that have no row to sit on, and every card NAMES its session and opens it, which is
 * the same "which one" the marker gives you, carried on the card instead of the row.
 *
 * ## What it costs
 *
 * Nothing extra. `useOpenSignalsByAttention()` splits the same cross-session read the
 * sidebar already makes for `useSessionsWithOpenOperatorQuestion`, through one 30s cache
 * entry keyed by `''`. Names for sessions the sidebar has not loaded
 * come from one batched lookup — see `useSessionNames`.
