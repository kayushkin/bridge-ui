// The pure rules behind the Principals page's Availability section: what a
// stored week becomes on the form, what the form becomes on the wire, and how
// an absence typed in a browser becomes the absolute range principal-store
// stores. No fetch, no React, so the PATCH body is pinned by tests.
//
// The wire contract is principal-store's `PATCH /principals/{id}` (CONTRACT.md
// "Availability"): `availability` is an object to replace the week, `{}` to
// clear it, absent to leave it alone.
//
// ⚠️ Whether someone is available is NOT decided here. principal-store reduces
// the week and the absences to one answer with one reason
// (`GET /principals/{id}/availability?at=`), and this page asks it. A client
// copy of that reduction would drift from the store's, and would have to invent
// the one thing the store refuses to invent — a zone for someone who has
// declared none.
