// A poll of one URL, shared by every component that asks for it.
//
// The hooks in this library used to each own their `useState` + `setInterval`,
// so a page that calls `useBridgeInstances()` from N components runs N
// 30-second polls of `/instances` and holds N copies of the answer. dash's
// dash's chat page does exactly that: four call sites — `Workspace` through
// `useNewSessionTarget`, `Sidebar`, `SessionHeader`, and `NewSessionMenu` while
// the picker is open — and three for its sibling `useBridgeMachines()`, which
// `NewSessionMenu`, `SessionHeader` and `Sidebar` share. Nothing was wrong with
// any single caller; the cost only shows up when you count the timers on the
// page.
//
// SharedPoll moves the timer and the snapshot out of the component. The first
// subscriber starts the poll, the rest attach to the answer it already has,
// and the last one to leave stops the timer. N callers cost one request.
//
// Deliberately not a cache library. It keeps the exact behaviour the hooks had
// — `loading` means "the first attempt has not settled yet" and stays false
// afterwards, a failed refresh keeps the last good data and sets `error`, and
// an unchanged payload keeps the previous array so React can bail out of the
// re-render. What changes is only how many sockets that costs.
//
// One rule sits on top: a request that never got an answer is retried within
// seconds and reported only when the retries fail too (`LoadFailure`), and the
// store asks again as soon as the browser comes back online or the page comes
// back into view. A refusal from the service is still reported at once.
