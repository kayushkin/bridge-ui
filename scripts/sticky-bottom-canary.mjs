//
// The panes are not remounted when the chat switches session — the rows are
// replaced under them — so everything about where a newly opened session
// starts is a question about state a hook carried over from the log before
// it. `npm run check` renders through react-dom/server, which has no layout
// and no scrollTop, so it cannot see any of this. Only a browser can.
//
// The load-bearing sequence is the one that reproduced the bug by hand:
// open a long session, scroll to the TOP of every pane, then pick a different
// session from the sidebar. Every pane that overflows must open at its
// newest end. Before the fix, Thread opened 971px from the bottom.
//
// It also checks the other direction, which is the way a careless fix breaks
// things: filtering the log the user is currently reading must NOT drag them
// to the bottom. A pin keyed on "the rows changed" passes the first check and
// fails this one.
//
// Not wired into `npm run check`: it needs a running app and Playwright. It
// borrows dash's Playwright install rather than adding one here — bridge-ui
// is a library and should not carry a browser.
//
// ⚠ Selector traps, all of which cost a run to find:
//   - Only the Turns pane is on by default. The other two are behind
//     `.bc-pane-toggle[aria-label="Timeline"|"Thread"]`.
//   - The scrolling element of each pane is `.bc-turns-body`, `.bc-thread`
//     (inside `.bc-thread-wrap`) and `.bc-timeline-body`. The wrappers do
//     not scroll.
//   - `.bc-session-item-main` is also what the sidebar's search results use;
//     index into it only after the list has settled.
