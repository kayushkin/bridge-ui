// separate one-shot fetches — one in each component that needed a harness's
// label, emoji, logo or availability. Both copies existed because there was no
// shared hook; there is now, and there is one poll behind it however many
// components ask.
//
// `basePath` is returned alongside because a HarnessInfo's `image` is
// server-relative: rendering the logo means `${basePath}${h.image}`, and a
// caller that only has the map cannot build that.
//
// Single source of truth: label, emoji, image, tint and availability all come
// from the server's HarnessInfo. There is no client-side fallback map. A
// harness the server has not registered simply has no entry, and callers fall
// through to whatever the session itself reports.
