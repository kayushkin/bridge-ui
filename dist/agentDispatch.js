// Handing a card to an agent.
//
// One implementation, because there are two ways to trigger it — the button on
// the card tile and the panel inside the drawer — and a second copy of this
// sequence would drift. The ordering below is the part that matters, and it is
// not obvious enough to reproduce correctly from memory.
/**
 * dispatchAgentOnCard creates an autonomous session, attaches it to the card,
 * sends the prompt, and returns the session id.
 *
 * The link is written BEFORE the prompt is sent. If the send fails, a linked
 * session is a visible loose end somebody can open from the board; an unlinked
 * one is a live agent nothing points at. Cost is the same either way, so the
 * order is chosen to make the failure findable.
 *
 * The session is `autonomous` because an unattended session that parks on a
 * permission prompt nobody is watching never finishes. That is the same type
 * autoworker and kanban-dispatcher already use, and it means tool calls are
 * auto-allowed — the reason this is worth a confirmation step in the UI.
 *
 * Throws on any failure rather than returning a status, so a caller cannot
 * quietly treat a failed dispatch as a started one.
