// Thread-pane state that belongs to the COMPONENT rather than to chat-core: whether
// assistant prose is rendered as markdown or as plain text (the header's MD/TXT toggle).
//
// ⚠️ This key is chat's own, for the same reason `sidebarPersistence.ts` gives for
// its two: dash served bridge-ui's chat beside its own while both existed, so they
// shared one origin and one localStorage. There is a second reason here, and it is the
// stronger one — bridge-ui's `MD_PREF_KEY` is a module-private constant in
// `TurnsView.tsx`, exported from nothing. Copying its literal would join the two pages
// on a name that bridge-ui is free to change without telling anyone, and the failure
// would be silent: chat would simply start each session on the default again.
//
// The two pages therefore keep separate preferences. That is a real divergence from
// the original chat and it is on purpose; the toggles are in different places (chat's
// is in `SessionHeader`, bridge-ui's is inside the Turns pane itself) and chat already
// diverges on folder collapse and the filter bar.
